      <h2>Polar Night</h2>
      <p>Polar Night is a natural phenomenon in which the night lasts more than 24 hours. This phenomenon only occurs inside the polar circle. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. There are different types of Polar Night like Polar Twilight, Civil Polar Night, Nautical Polar Night, adn Astronomical Polar Night. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun.</p>

      <h2>Light Pollution</h2>
      <p>Light pollution, also known as photopollution, is excessive, misdirected or obtrusive artificial light. As a major side-effect of urbanization, it is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments. Light pollution competes with starlight in the night sky for urban residents, interferes with astronomical observatories,[5] and, like any other form of pollution, disrupts ecosystems and has adverse health effects. Light pollution is a side effect of industrial civilization. Its sources include building exterior and interior lighting, advertising, commercial properties, offices, factories, streetlights, and illuminated sporting venues.</p>

      <h2>Royal Stars</h2>
      <p>Royal Stars are the terminology referred tp the four stars located in the Earth' elliptical orbit. In astrology, the Royal Stars of Persia are Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomalhaut. They were regarded as the guardians of the sky in approximately 3000 BCE during the time of the Ancient Persians in the area of modern-day Iran. The reason why they are called "Royal" is that they appear to stand aside from the other stars in the sky. The four stars, Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares, Fomalhaut, are the brightest stars in their constellations and among the 25 brightest stars in the night sky.</p>

      <h2>Astrophotography</h2>
      <p>Astrophotography is a specialized type of photography for recording images of astronomical objects and large areas of the night sky. The first photograph of an astronomical object (the Moon) was taken in 1840, but it was not until the late 19th century that advances in technology allowed for detailed stellar photography. Besides being able to record the details of extended objects such as the Moon, Sun, and planets, astrophotography has the ability to image objects invisible to the human eye such as dim stars, nebulae, and galaxies. Astrophotography is a large subdiscipline in amateur astronomy usually seeking aesthetically pleasing images rather than scientific data. </p>
